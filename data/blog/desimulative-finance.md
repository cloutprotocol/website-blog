### STATE OF THINGS

We are isolated veterans of the 21st century. Prophetic sci-fi technology and old-fashioned animal tendency has us on a moon shot for mars, and perhaps to earth’s destruction, we will end. Humans are a perturbed species of mammals with far-out visions of AI and synthetic biology. There’s no end to psychotic fetishes like replacing bees, if only they could be designed in a lab. Paralleling opportunity drives us towards digital finance and currencies, while the legacy financial system pillages modern economics. Workers create the pillars for an elite financial structure, and on us, they bet. Philanthropy is often quasi-altruistic while more is needed. Do-good Incentives are lacking in public and private life. Propagandized virtue creates a dull vision of possibility. Media voids and Netflix-like homogenization of content have made a mockery of what reality is or can be. In this realm advancing the species shouldn’t always be a book match of the modern state of tech.

### SOLUTION-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE

By design, It is very hard for everyday citizens to interface with solution-based infrastructure. Calling the police is a solution often met with random results. There is a go-fund-me style strategy on the street level for everyday citizens, but it is a one-dimensional procedure. To meet the scale of the impending inevitability that problems will occur, and will need fixing, we need an entire freeway system for the verbose solution-based capital, both in its tangible and intangible form. Perhaps only then will the cultural shift occur where we lead a life with a solutions-first approach.

### KEEP SCROLLING

Social tech giants have weaponized legacy web 2.0. Intentionally designed algorithms are a loss leader for ad-revenue hammering away at the synapsis of 5 billion active users. At times we have seen the power of online organization, but cyberspace is not a level playing field. Backdoors, algorithmic switches, neural networks and more, crawl us like spiders foraging profitable data. Google ingests a real-time stream of consciousness, creating a very powerful consolidation of thought and turned into a client-side node for aggregate software. LoT devices and wearables rolled out as kitschy wares, but now we find they had an ulterior motive. Soon we will be trapped in a hexagonal grid of technological and software apparatuses. Needs for dissimulation will also breed a new market to re-discover the world prior to this overhaul.

### ALIGNMENT OF VALUES

It can feel as though we are on the precipice of something great. Yet there’s a spiritual battle for the mind of society. Gatekeepers and central planners would like to bury the “age of Aquarius” in their underground bunkers, all the while, economic stressors dampen the IQ of everyday citizens forcing them into remedial work. To align our values, we must first shrug the cynicism which has been embedded in culture by design and rise out of the matrix. "De-Simulative Finance" is our contribution to this endeavor.

### INTRODUCING DE-SIMULATIVE FINANCE

De-simulative finance accepts the fetishization of tech, while shelving its appeal. In a bright world of unicorns and pancakes, nerds and degenerates are the driving force of decentralized finance (Defi). Soon more sophisticated engineering will be made by banks and giants who want to capitalize on a good thing. De-Simulative Finance is intended to proliferate the web and create new avenues for discovery.
